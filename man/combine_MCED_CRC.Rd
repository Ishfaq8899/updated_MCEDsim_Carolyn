\description{
Integrates colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes with MCED simulation results. The function:
(1) filters additional cancers to those clinically diagnosable before other-cause death,
(2) simulates cancer-specific survival for these additional cancers,
(3) reassigns additional cancers to individuals without a primary cancer diagnosis using
5-year other-cause-death age strata, and
(4) computes competing-risk outcomes (diagnosis ages/events and death ages/events) for
both screening and no-screening scenarios, including an overdiagnosis indicator.

\details{
The reassignment algorithm attempts to match each additional cancer to an individual
without a primary cancer diagnosis in the same 5-year other-cause-death age stratum.
If a match is found, the additional cancer is reassigned to that individual; unmatched
additional cancers increment no_match_counter.
