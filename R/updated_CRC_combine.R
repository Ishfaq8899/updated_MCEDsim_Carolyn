#' Simulate a cohort of individuals with and without Multicancer Early Detection (MCED) screening
#'
#' @description
#' This function simulates cancer outcomes in a population with a designated starting age using a "parallel universe" approach.
#' That is, cancer outcomes in the population are simulated with and without MCED screening.  The natural history (i.e., the times of cancer onset and clinical diagnosis) for
#' each individual is the same in both screening and no-screening scenarios.
#'
#' The user specifies cancer sites in the MCED screening test.
#' The user also provides sensitivity of the tests for early and late-stage disease, where early refers
#' to AJCC 7 stages I-II and late, III-IV, except for pancreas cancer, where early is stage I and late, II-IV.
#'
#' Natural history models are based on built-in fitted models that are calibrated to SEER 2015-2021 data by age and sex and can be specified based on
#' user-provided inputs about the overall mean sojourn time (OMST) and the late mean sojourn time (LMST) for each cancer site.
#' The function tracks only the first cancer diagnosis based on pre-clinical onset.
#'
#' Other-cause mortality is based on all cause mortality tables from the Human Mortality Database that have been adjusted to remove the mortality due to
#' cancers included in the MCED tests.  Cancer-specific mortality in the screen arm assumes a stage-shift benefit of screening. That is, individuals
#' who are diagnosed in early stage under screening but who would have been diagnosed in late stage clinically, are assume to remain in early stage post lead-time.
#' For both screened and unscreened individuals, cancer mortality is projected from the point of clinical diagnosis (i.e., post lead-time) to prevent
#' lead-time bias.
#'
#' @param cancer_sites Vector of cancer sites (allowable values include
#'   "Anus",  "Bladder", "Esophagus", "Gastric", "Headandneck",
#'  "Liver", "Lung", "Lymphoma", "Ovary", "Pancreas", "Renal", "Uterine")
#'
#' @param LMST_vec Numeric vector of late mean sojourn times (years) for each cancer site.
#' @param OMST_vec Numeric vector of overall mean sojourn times (years) for each cancer site.
#' @param test_performance_dataframe Data frame with test sensitivity/specificity info.
#' @param MCED_specificity Overall specificity for the MCED test (not specific to cancer site)
#' @param starting_age Numeric starting age for simulation
#' @param ending_age Numeric ending age for simulation
#' @param num_screens Number of screening rounds.
#' @param screen_interval Interval between screening rounds.
#' @param num_males Number of male individuals to simulate.
#' @param num_females Number of female individuals to simulate.
#' @param all_rates_male List of transition matrices for males.
#' @param all_rates_female List of transition matrices for females.
#' @param all_meta_data_female Metadata for female cancer sites.
#' @param all_meta_data_male Metadata for male cancer sites.
#' @param cdc_data CDC mortality data.
#' @param hmd_data Human Mortality Database data.
#' @param MCED_cdc CDC data for MCED.
#' @param surv_param_table Data frame of cancer-specific survival parameters.
#' @param CRC_data CRC data.
#' @param simulation_seed Set seed for each simulation
#' @export
#'
#' @return A data frame with combined simulated results for all individuals.
#' The function returns each individual's first cancer site,  age and stage of clinical diagnosis in
#' absence of screening, age and stage at screen diagnosis, the time of other-cause mortality, and the time of cancer-specific mortality in absence
#' and presence of screening.   Cancer diagnosis and death times are presented both with and without competing other-cause mortality.

#' Combine MCED Results with Colorectal Cancer Data
#'
#' @description
#' Integrates colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes with MCED simulation results. The function:
#' (1) filters additional cancers to those clinically diagnosable before other-cause death,
#' (2) simulates cancer-specific survival for these additional cancers,
#' (3) reassigns additional cancers to individuals without a primary cancer diagnosis using
#'     5-year other-cause-death age strata, and
#' (4) computes competing-risk outcomes (diagnosis ages/events and death ages/events) for
#'     both screening and no-screening scenarios, including an overdiagnosis indicator.
#'
#' @param merged_CRC_MCED_results  Data frame that combine the CRC with MCEDsim data for a particular scenario.
#' @param combined_additional_results Data frame of additional (non-first) cancer diagnoses
#' @param starting_age Numeric starting age for cohort
#' @param ending_age Numeric ending age for simulation
#' @param surv_param_table Data frame of cancer-specific survival parameters
#'
#' @details
#' The reassignment algorithm attempts to match each additional cancer to an individual
#'  without a primary cancer diagnosis in the same 5-year other-cause-death age stratum.
#'  If a match is found, the additional cancer is reassigned to that individual; unmatched
#'  additional cancers increment no_match_counter.
